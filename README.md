# Installing and Setting Up Visual Studio Code on Windows 11

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a versatile and powerful code editor that supports various programming languages and development tools. Here is a comprehensive guide to installing and setting up VS Code on Windows 11:

Step 1: Download Visual Studio Code

Visit the Official Website:

Open your web browser and go to the Visual Studio Code download page.
Download the Installer:

Click on the download link for Windows. This will download the VS Code installer file (e.g., VSCodeUserSetup-x64-<version>.exe).

Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
Run the Installer:

Locate the downloaded installer file (VSCodeUserSetup-x64-<version>.exe) in your Downloads folder and double-click it to start the installation.
Installation Wizard:

License Agreement:

The installer will open with the license agreement. Read through it and, if you agree, click "I accept the agreement" and then "Next".
Select Destination Location:

Choose the installation destination folder. The default location is usually C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code. Click "Next" to continue.
Select Additional Tasks:

You will be prompted to select additional tasks. It's recommended to check the following options:
"Create a desktop icon"
"Add to PATH" (this option allows you to open VS Code from the command line).
Any other options that suit your preferences (e.g., adding context menu entries).
Install:

Click "Next" and then "Install" to begin the installation process. The installer will copy files and set up VS Code on your system.
Complete Installation:

Once the installation is complete, you can choose to launch Visual Studio Code immediately by checking the "Launch Visual Studio Code" option. Click "Finish" to complete the setup.

Step 3: First Launch and Initial Setup
Launch VS Code:

If you didn't launch VS Code during the installation process, you can open it by clicking the new desktop icon or by finding it in the Start menu.
Welcome Screen:

On the first launch, you will see the Welcome screen, which provides useful links to tutorials, customization options, and settings.
Customize Settings:

Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or press Ctrl+,) to access the settings. Here you can customize various aspects of the editor, such as:
Theme: Choose a light or dark theme.
Font Size: Adjust the font size for better readability.
Tab Size: Customize the tab size to match your coding style.

Step 4: Install Extensions
Extensions greatly enhance the functionality of VS Code. Hereâ€™s how to install them:

Open Extensions View:

Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
Browse and Search for Extensions:

Use the search bar at the top of the Extensions view to find specific extensions by name or functionality (e.g., "Python", "Git", "Docker").
Install Extensions:

Click on an extension to view its details. Click the green "Install" button to add the extension to your VS Code setup.
Popular Extensions to Consider:

Language Support:
Python: ms-python.python
JavaScript/TypeScript: ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next
Java: redhat.java
C++: ms-vscode.cpptools
Code Formatting:
Prettier: esbenp.prettier-vscode
ESLint: dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
Version Control:
GitLens: eamodio.gitlens
GitHub Pull Requests and Issues: github.vscode-pull-request-github
Docker and Container Management:
Docker: ms-azuretools.vscode-docker
Remote Development:
Remote - WSL: ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
Remote - SSH: ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
Remote - Containers: ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

Step 5: Configure Integrated Terminal
Open Terminal:

Go to View > Terminal (or press `Ctrl+``) to open the integrated terminal within VS Code.
Configure Terminal Settings:

Access terminal settings via File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Terminal". Here you can set the default shell (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Git Bash).

Step 6: Start Coding
Open a Folder or Workspace:

Go to File > Open Folder to open a folder containing your project files.
Create or Open Files:

Use the Explorer view to create new files or open existing ones. Right-click in the Explorer view to create a new file or folder.
Start Writing Code:

Begin coding in your chosen language. VS Code will provide syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and other language-specific features based on the installed extensions.
